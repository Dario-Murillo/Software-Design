# Software Design

This repositoy contains multiple examples and exercises that contain code following creational, behavioural and structural desing patterns. This repository was used to put in practice clean clode architecture and solid principles, as part of a software design course. There's also a YAML file used in a CI/CD pipeline that I set in azure.
